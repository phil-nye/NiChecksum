# NiChecksum
Generates and compares checksum (md5 or sha1) of a file in your file system to the value given by the file provider.

WIP (TODO):

Still needs a GUI element so you could just drag and drop the file to get its path, and whatever other element values.

Probably want to change from using Java Security to BouncyCastle at some point.

Runtime could be improved.

Could also include ability to use other hash modes.
